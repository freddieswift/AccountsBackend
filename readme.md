# Accounts Analysis

## Overview

The aim of this project is to create an application for my Dad to use in his business.

My dad runs a factory that makes socks and currently does a lot of his financial calculations manually using Excel. He currently has a big spreadsheet with all his cost of sales and overheads and uses it to work out the profit for the year.

At present, he does not have a way of using this data to find out how much each sock costs to make.

The aim of this project is to: 
- Create a web app to use instead of a spreadsheet. The web app should have all the same functionality as the spreadsheet. 
- Extend the application to use the data provided to calculate the manufacturing costs per sock

## API
This is the repo for the back end of this project. I decided to create a REST API using node.js and express and to store data in a MongoDB database
